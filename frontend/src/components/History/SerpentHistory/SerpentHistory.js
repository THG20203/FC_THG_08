          FC THG 08's logo features a sea serpent, a symbol chosen to reflect
          the deep connection between the football team and its port city's
          maritime heritage. As a representation of the city's ties to the sea,
          the sea serpent emblem embodies the club's identity as a unifying
          force within the community, blending the vigor of the sport with the
          resilience and mystique of the ocean.
        </p>
        <p className="sea-serpent__description paragraph-text mb-sm">
          The sea serpent emblem also serves as a reminder of the club's
          founders and their vision to create a football club that transcended
          cultural boundaries, much like the ever-flowing sea that knows no
          borders.
