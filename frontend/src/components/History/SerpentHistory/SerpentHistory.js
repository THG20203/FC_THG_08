          FC THG 08's logo features a sea serpent, a symbol chosen to reflect
          the deep connection between the football team and its port city's
          maritime heritage. As a representation of the city's ties to the sea,
          the sea serpent emblem embodies the club's identity as a unifying
          force within the community, blending the vigor of the sport with the
          resilience and mystique of the ocean.
