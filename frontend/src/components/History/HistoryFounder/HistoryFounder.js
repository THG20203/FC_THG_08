          In the late 19th century, amidst the industrial clamor of a bustling
          port city, a unique and storied football club, FC THG 08, emerged. The
          year was 1893, and the city's docks were alive with the toil of
          sailors, laborers, and merchants from near and far. Amidst the clatter
          of cargo and the sea's embrace, a group of eight passionate
          individuals found themselves drawn together by their shared love for
          the game and the palpable sense of unity they observed among the
          dockworkers.

        <p className="paragraph-text mb-sm">
          As the founding members of FC THG 08, their names reflected the
          mingling of British and German heritage, embodying the cross-cultural
          spirit of the port city.
